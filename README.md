# OracleNextEducationCourse - Currency Converter
This project is part of Oracle Next Education Program, in this course we are challenged to create a currency converter by consola, the use of APIs was useful, in this case I used [ExchangeRateAPI](https://app.exchangerate-api.com) in this through a country base code we can make a request and receive the conversion with different codes.
## :hammer: Project Functionalities

- `Functionality 1`: There's a series of options where you need yo choose what type of currency you are going to convert.
- `Functionality 2`: Also while you are interacting with the program, you could consult for the historial of your actions.
